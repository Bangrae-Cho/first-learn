            <p>Trigger sensors are detection by continuesly turning by turning gear or engine running. <br> mean, can't check sensor's work by touching </p>

                <li>What is Encoder?<br>Encoder main function is reading angle of Crank shaft for define control timing</li>
                <li>How many signals are in a Encoder?<br>basically, 4 signals in a Encoder<br>Mark 1(Reading 180degree)<br>Makr 2(Reading 180Degree)<br>
                    Quadrature 1(Reading 360 pulse in 1 revolution)<br>
                    Quadrature 2(Reading 360 pulse in 1 revolution. 0.5degree different angle from Quadrature 1)</li>
                <li>How to adjust gap and position?<br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>For Q1A</li>
                        <li>Turn the engine to TDC1.</li>

                        <li>Making touch the Adjusting tool bottom on trig ring each teethes by Adjusting bolt</li>

                        <li> Check that the diode of the Q1A-sensor points directly towards the trigger ring tangent line in the opposite <br>
                        direction of engine's main running direction. if this is not the case, <br>
                        then loosen the sensor nouts and turn the sensor about its symmetrical axis to obtain the above diode position.<br>
                        Please note that th Q-signals are extremely sensitive to the sensor's rotational position.</li>

                        <li>Repeat the above for the remaining Q-sensors.</li>
                        <li>Loosen the screws holding the mountin plate for the Q1A pickup box to the main tacho bracket.</li>
                        <li>Position the Q1 sensor box with mounting plate the gap evenly on both sides of the sensor.<br>
                        The adjustment tool will ensure a radial distance of 1 mm for from the tip of the trigger ring teeth to the sensor head.<br>
                        Add a feeler gauge of 0.5mm between the sensor head and the adjustment tool so the final distance is 1.5 mm between the sensor and the trigger ring.</li>
                        <li>Tighten the screws firmly to secure the mounting plate with pick-up box in a locked position.</li>
                        <li>Remove the tool.</li>
                        <li>Loosen the screws holding the mounting plate for the Q2A pick-up box to the main tacho bracket.<br>
                        <li>Position the Q2A sensor box with mounting plate in the Q2 slot on adjustment tool.<br>
                        The slot is slightly wider than the sensor head diameter, so distribue the gap envenly on both sides of the sensor.<br>
                        Add a feeler gauge of 0.5 mm between the sensor head and the adjustment tool so the final distance is 1.5 mm between the sensor and the trigger ring.</li>
                        <li>Tighten the screws firmly to secure the mounting plate with pick-up box in a lock position.</li>
                        <li>Remove the tool.</li>
                        <li>Repeat the operation for the Q1/2B sensors.</li>
                </ol>
